# simple-recursive-descent-parser-for-toy-grammar

A simple recursive descent parser implemented in C, to evaluate a simple grammar for arithmetic expressions.

This repository directly builds upon skeleton files written and provided by **Prof. Hing Leung, PhD, NMSU** for the course **CS370 (Compiler and Automata)**. The [Wiki for this repository](https://github.com/jkeys-nmsu/simple-recursive-descent-parser-for-toy-grammar/wiki) contains the lab prompt as written by Dr. Leung. 

To distinguish my work from Dr. Leung's, simply compare the skeleton files (in skeleton_files) with the files in the main repository folder.
